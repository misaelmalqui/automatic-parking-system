This work is aimed to develop an automatic parking system to be implemented in autonomous vehicles. At the first stage, the vehicle detects the environment via a LIDAR sensor and stores it. This information is used to identify the feasible maneuvers, which are previously studied, and finally it follows one of these trajectories. The efficiency of this program is studied by testing the recognition and execution in different configurations, and finally a trailer is studied from an iterative approach.
